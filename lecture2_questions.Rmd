## Developing a Question
### Interests

  - Why major in political science?
  - What do you do for enrichment?
  - What interests you about these things?
  - What about courses or parts of courses?

## Developing a Question
### Importance

  - Who is your audience?
  - What have other people identified as important?
  - Is there a puzzle?
  - \textbf{why, how, to what extent, under what conditions}

## Developing a Question
### Brevity and Concision

 - Short and to the point 
 - Avoid extensive background

## Examples

\textcolor{red}{Bad}

## Examples

\textcolor{red}{Bad}

\small{Committees are an important part of the U.S. Congress.  Many researchers have noted that institutions like committees can have important impacts on legislative outcomes.  Also, Congress controls all government spending in the United States.  How then do committees impact spending?}
  
\textcolor{green}{Good}  
How does seniority and the committee structure impact roll-call voting on social spending bills?
