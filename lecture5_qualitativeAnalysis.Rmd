## Coding

 - Unit of analysis
 - Inter-coder reliability
 - Ask questions
 - Categories variable and flexible

## Memo Writing

- Personal reflections on experiences, issues, patterns
- Used in conjunction with coding
- Code book/Research log

## Displaying Data

- \textbf{Taxonomy}: system of ordered classification  
  
- \textbf{Data Matrix}: individuals or other units represent columns and coding categories represent rows  
  
- \textbf{Typology}: representation of findings based on the interrelationship between two or more ideas, concepts, or variables  
  
- \textbf{Flow Chart}: diagrams that display processes

## Drawing and Evaluating Conclusions
### Conclusions
- Descriptive $\leftrightarrow$ Theoretical

### Evaluations
- Compare notes
- Exceptions
- Member checking

## Grounded Theory

 - Constant-comparative method
 - Memo-writing

## Narrative Analysis
